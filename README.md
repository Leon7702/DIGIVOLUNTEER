https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1549e273-5bd4-49f1-88c7-dc84186bbd85


A full-cycle usability project focused on designing a digital volunteering platform for students and early-career professionals. This platform emphasizes micro-volunteering, intuitive navigation, and gamified motivation.

## Overview

This project was structured around the **User-Centered Design process**, progressing through four main phases:

1. Discover – Research 
2. Decide – Concept definition  
3. Make – Design & prototyping  
4. Evaluate – User testing & iteration

---

## Phase 1: Discover

### Goals
- Understand the needs, motivations, and barriers for digital volunteering
- Analyze the current market and identify pain points

### Activities
- Conducted online surveys and interviews
- Mapped a User Journey
- Performed competitor analysis (Youvo, Gute Tat, Vostel)

### Key Insights
- Time constraints are a major blocker for young volunteers
- Users want short-term, skill-matched opportunities
- Existing platforms are cluttered or hard to navigate

## Phase 2: Decide

### Goals
- Synthesize data into usable models
- Define clear user groups and core features

### Activities
- Created an **Affinity Diagram**
- Developed 8 **Personas** (students, professionals, newcomers)
- Built a **Value Proposition Canvas**

### Key Decisions
- Focus on micro-volunteering for students
- Platform should offer filtering, gamification, and a clean UI

## Phase 3: Make

### Goals
- Translate ideas into visual and interactive designs
- Develop core screens and user flow

### Activities
- Sketched paper prototypes for key screens
- Created low- and high-fidelity mockups in Figma
- Designed multiple variations of the home, opportunities, and profile pages
- Collaboratively merged individual designs into final prototype

### Design Features
- Gamified user profile with badges and certificates
- Filterable opportunity listings
- Clean, mobile-friendly layout
- Onboarding flow tailored to volunteers vs. organizations
